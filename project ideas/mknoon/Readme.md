### Abstract P0
Customers increasingly rely on reviews for product information. However, the usefulness of online reviews is impeded by fake reviews that give an untruthful picture of product quality. Therefore, detection of fake reviews is needed. Unfortunately, so far, automatic detection has only had partial success in this challenging task. In this research, we address the creation and detection of fake reviews. First, we experiment with two language models, ULMFiT and GPT-2, to generate fake product reviews based on an Amazon e-commerce dataset. Using the better model, GPT-2, we create a dataset for a classification task of fake review detection. We show that a machine classifier can accomplish this goal near-perfectly, whereas human raters exhibit significantly lower accuracy and agreement than the tested algorithms. The model was also effective on detected human generated fake reviews. The results imply that, while fake review detection is challenging for humans, “machines can fight machines” in the task of detecting fake reviews. Our findings have implications for consumer protection, defense of firms from unfair competition, and responsibility of review platforms.

### Abstract P1
This study provides an applicable methodological procedure applying Artificial Intelligence (AI)-based supervised Machine Learning (ML) algorithms in detecting fake reviews of online review platforms and identifies the best ML algorithm as well as the most critical fake review determinants for a given restaurant review dataset. Our empirical findings from analyzing 16 determinants (review-related, reviewer-related, and linguistic attributes) measured from over 43,000 online restaurant reviews reveal that among the seven ML algorithms, the random forest algorithm outperforms the other algorithms and, among the 16 review attributes, time distance is found to be the most important, followed by two linguistic (affective and cognitive cues) and two review-related attributes (review depth and structure). The present study contributes to the literature on fake online review detection, especially in the hospitality field and the body of knowledge on supervised ML algorithms.

### Abstract P2
Now a days the usage of Internet and online marketing has become very popular. Millions of products and services are available in online marketing that generate huge amount of information. Hence, it's difficult to find the best suitable services or products compatible to the requirement. Customers directly take decision based on reviews or opinions that are written by others based on their experiences. In this competitive world any person can write anything, this raise the number of fake reviews. Various companies are hiring people to write fake positive reviews about their services or products or unfair negative reviews about their competitors' services or products. This process gives wrong input to the new customers who wish to buy such items and hence we need a system to detect such fake reviews and remove them. In this paper we discuss various supervised, unsupervised and semi supervised data mining techniques for fake review detection based on different features.
